3) Convolution: https://youtu.be/KuXjwB4LzSA
4) Got a general idea of CNNs through the link provided
5) Explored and understood NLP from: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeo1K3hjS3uuvuAXhYjV2lMEShq2UYSwX
6) Implemented a seq2seq model used for machine translation: https://youtu.be/EoGUlvhRYpk
7) Implemented a basic Multi-layer perceptron model to classify the images in CIFAR10 dataset
8) Learnt about RNNs, CNN-LSTM from the link provided
9) Made a face-recognition model using PyTorch to classify the faces of celebrities from Labelled Faces in the Wild
10) I've written the code for image caption generation, however, I haven't produced satisfactory results yet, and I'm working on it
